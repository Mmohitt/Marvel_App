Marvel Character App
Welcome to the Marvel Character App! This Android application is built using Kotlin and follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture. It utilizes Retrofit for network requests, Room Database for local storage, ViewModel and LiveData for efficient data management, Glide for seamless image loading, RecyclerView for displaying lists of Marvel characters, and more.


Features
Marvel Character Data: Fetches comprehensive character details, including descriptions, stories, comics, comic details, and images, from the official Marvel API website.

Offline Access: Stores fetched data locally in a Room Database, ensuring that you can still access character information even when offline.

Smooth Image Loading: Utilizes Glide image loading library to provide a smooth and efficient image loading experience.

Elegant UI: Displays character data in a clean and user-friendly interface powered by RecyclerView.

Architecture
The Marvel Character App is built using Kotlin and follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern. The key components of the architecture are:

Model: Handles the data and business logic. Manages communication with the network and local database.

View: Represents the UI elements. Observes ViewModel's LiveData and reacts to data changes.

ViewModel: Manages UI-related data and communicates with the Model. Provides data to the View using LiveData.

The app's data flow involves fetching character data from the Marvel API using Retrofit, storing the data in the Room Database, and then displaying it in the UI using RecyclerView and LiveData.

Libraries Used
Retrofit: A type-safe HTTP client for making network requests.

Room Database: A robust and flexible local storage solution for caching data.

ViewModel: Manages UI-related data and handles configuration changes.

LiveData: Provides an observable data holder that updates the UI when data changes.

Glide: A fast and efficient image loading library for Android.

RecyclerView: A powerful UI component for displaying lists and grids.
